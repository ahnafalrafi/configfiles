* ~ahnafalrafi's~ configuration files

Yet another declaration of Emacs Bankruptcy gave birth to this iteration of my
configuration files.
In the ~./emacs/~ directory, you will find a literate configuration for
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] written in
[[https://orgmode.org/][the ~org-mode~ markup language]].
The relevant file is ~init.org~.
The Emacs Lisp source files tangled from this ~org~ file are also included in
that directory.
In time, I will have a version of this ~org~ file published to my website
[[https://ahnafalrafi.com][ahnafalrafi.com]].

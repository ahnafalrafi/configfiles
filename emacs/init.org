* Local variables
The end of this file has the following comment block.
#+begin_src org :tangle no
# Local Variables:
# eval: (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'org-babel-tangle nil t)
# End:
#+end_src
This hook is local to current file and ensures that upon saving changes,
any code blocks without a ~:tangle no~ flag gets written to a file with the
relevant extension.
At the beginning of this file, there is a header comment setting the following
property for all Emacs Lisp code blocks.
#+begin_src org
#+property: header-args:emacs-lisp  :tangle init.el
#+end_src
This means that any Emacs Lisp code block gets tangled to ~init.el~ unless told
otherwise.
Some code blocks in this file will be asked to tangle out to some other file,
for example with a ~:tangle early-init.el~ argument.
